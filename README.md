## Game Rules
The goal is to guess the correct answers for each question to test your 90s cartoon skills. There are 10 questions total, with 10 seconds to answer each one by clicking on the possible answers. If time runs out before you click an answer, it counted as unanswered and move on to the next. Once the game is over your score will be displayed at the end.
